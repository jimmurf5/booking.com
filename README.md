# University Database Project: Reverse Engineered from booking.com

## Introduction
This repository contains the SQL backup of our university database project. The structure and sample data of the database are reverse engineered from the booking.com website.

## Database Backup
The SQL backup file (`booking_com.sql`) contains both the schema and sample data for the database. It's the last backup of the project and includes pre-populated tables with sample data.

## Usage
To use the SQL backup:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Import the `booking_com.sql` file into your preferred SQL environment to recreate the database along with its tables and sample data.
3. You can then start querying the database or use it for your project.

## Disclaimer
This database backup is created for educational purposes only and is based on observations of the booking.com website. It is not affiliated with booking.com in any way and should not be used for any commercial purposes.
